# EELS – Entry and Exit Log System

EELS (Entry and Exit Log System) is a modern access logging platform designed to track entry and exit activities using a web-based interface and IoT integration. It combines a React + Vite frontend, an Express.js backend, and an RFID-based IoT prototype for secure and seamless access management.

## Features

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- Fast and responsive UI powered by Vite
- Real-time entry and exit log visualization
- Clean dashboard interface
- User-friendly RFID card registration

### Backend (Express.js)
- Secure communication between frontend and IoT devices
- Scalable and modular architecture

### IoT Prototype
- RFID scanner integration for physical access control
- Registered card validation (Step 3 setup)
- Tested using Arduino / ESP32 hardware
- Real-time data transmission to backend
